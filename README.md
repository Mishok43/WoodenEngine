# WoodenEngine
Wooden Engine is 3D Graphics Engine for rendering 3D scenes with minimal logic. It was started as my first course project. 

Technologies:
DirectX 12, C++14, WinUniversal

Implemented features:
- Basic geometry shapes meshes generator
- Exporter models data from some formats
- Drawing static opaque objects
- Drawing transparent objects
- Drawing alpha-test objects
- Texturing 
- Point, spot, directional lights
- Ambient occlusion, specular light, diffuse
- LODs, Billboard (geometry shaders)
- Bezier curves\surfaces, tesselation
- Planar shadows
- Materials
- Normal mapping
- Resource manager
- Postprocessing effects (blur for example) using compute shaders
- Simple water
